- group icons and switch between them with (the middle mousebutton -- make it later so if we than whant it and the integration is mutch easyer) a small arrow on the left side on a icon.
- change the size of the tray dynamically (use the max lines for the maximum)
- add a way to set the systemtray icons to every cards on the tab(menubar)
